Sure! I can help you create a profile screen using Flutter widgets. Here's an example of how you can build a basic profile screen:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Profile'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            CircleAvatar(
              radius: 50,
              backgroundImage: AssetImage('assets/profile_image.jpg'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              'John Doe',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              'Software Developer',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 16,
                color: Colors.grey,
              ),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.email),
                SizedBox(width: 8),
                Text('johndoe@example.com'),
              ],
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.phone),
                SizedBox(width: 8),
                Text('+1 123-456-7890'),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using a `Scaffold` widget as the main container for the profile screen. Inside the `Scaffold`, we have an `AppBar` for the screen title and a `Container` as the body.

Within the `Container`, we use various Flutter widgets to display the profile information. We have a `CircleAvatar` for the profile image, `Text` widgets to display the name and job title, and `Row` widgets with `Icon` and `Text` to display the email and phone number.

You can customize this example to fit your specific needs. Don't forget to replace the image path with your own profile image path.

I hope this helps you get started with creating a profile screen in Flutter! Let me know if you have any further questions.
